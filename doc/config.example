# for the tripledragon platform: the version of the compiler to build
# "old" => build gcc 3.4.5 / glibc 2.3.6 with crosstool-0.43
# "new" => build gcc 4.5.2 / eglibc 2.12 with crosstool-ng 1.10.0
# defaults to "old" for now, but I'd recommend people to try out "new" too
#TD_COMPILER=new

# if you want to use your precompiled toolchain, define those variables:
# this will skip the building of our own compiler/glibc combination!
#
# ONLY CHANGE THOSE VARIABLES IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
#
# do not set this if you want to build a toolchain with these makefiles.

# build type, specify it here. THIS IS A WORKAROUND. Use with caution.
