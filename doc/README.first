The Neutrino-HD Build System
============================

The build system is configured with the file "config" in the top directory.
This file is normally not present, but an example config file is located
in this doc/ directory which can be copied into the top directory.

Defaults of the different options are:

	PLATFORM = tripledragon
	CROSS_DIR =
	TARGET =
	BUILD =
	FLAVOUR =
	PKG_DEST_DIR =

Empty settings mean that sensible defaults will be chosen, this is what
you should probably try first.

The command "make" without parameters will show you a summary of the
current settings and give hints on potential configuration errors.

The command "make help" will show you the most commonly used make targets.

Some are also listed here:
* make preqs - downloads necessary stuff, mainly the neutrino-hd source
  code, according to your FLAVOUR and the drivers / libraries from the
  Coolstream or Tripledragon SVN repositories. If something is wrong
  or needs to be done manually, there will be a message telling you so.
  So please read the output.
* make crosstool - builds the cross toolchain. This is usually only
  needed once. The toolchain is installed in the cross/ directory.
* make bootstrap - prepares for building. Mainly by copying stuff into
  the TARGETPREFIX (root/) and by setting up some symlinks in host/bin
  for helper scripts. "make bootstrap" can (and should) be repeated,
  if parts of the buildsystem have been updated.

Those three targets, "preqs", "crosstool" and "bootstrap" must complete
successfully before continuing. If one of them aborts with an error,
simply continuing is not an option. Read the output (it might give hints
on what went wrong), fix the problem and run the target again.

Note that the coolstream platform is officially unsupported, if it breaks,
you get to keep the pieces. Patches to fix it are welcome as long as they
don't break the supported platforms.

Contributors:
=============
contributions are always welcome, best in the form of pull-requests
or patches generated by git format-patch.
Note that one policy for accepting patches (for legal reasons) is, that
you act with a real name, in other words the "From: " line in the patch
lists your real name. If you have a problem with this please contact me.

Have a lot of fun...
